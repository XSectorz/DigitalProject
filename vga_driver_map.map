WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   BTN_RESTART_BTN_START_AND_51_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   437 out of   1,430   30%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     1,252 out of   2,860   43%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,453

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              88 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
